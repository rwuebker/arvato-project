# This project is the capstone for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree.

The report (report.pdf) outlines the steps taken in this project. There are two main parts:
  1. Market Segmentation: The notebook for this is "Market Segmentation Final.ipynb"
  2. Prediction. The prediction notebooks are the following and progress in this order:
    * Initial_Prediction.ipynb
    * SMOTE_Experimentation.ipynb
    * Feature_Selection.ipynb
    * Feature_Engineering.ipynb
    * Hyperparameter_Tuning_AWS.ipynb

Some notes:

 * A metadata file was used heavily for both portions of the project and is located in the data/ directory
 * The interactions produced by Create_Interactions.ipynb are located in the experimentation/ directory
 * The interactions are heavily used in the Feature Engineering.ipynb notebook.
 * The features produced from k-means cluster analysis are in the experimentation/ directory.
 * The features in the experimentation/ directory are used in the Feature_Selection notebook.
